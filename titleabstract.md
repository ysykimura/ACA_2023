### The rigid parts of the elements of the real Grothendieck groups
This talk is based on joint work with Osamu Iyama in progress.
Let $A$ be a finite-dimensional algebra over a field $K$.
Then, in the homotopy category $\mathsf{K}^\mathrm{b}(\mathrm{proj}A)$, any 2-term complex $X$ has the maximum presilting direct summand, which can be called the rigid part of $X$.
By using decompositions of 2-term complexes, Derksen-Fei introduced the canonical decompositions in the Grothendieck group $K_0(\mathrm{proj} A)$, so we can define the rigid part of each $\theta \in K_0(\mathrm{proj} A)$ from its canonical decomposition.
However, in this definition, it is open whether the rigid part of $m \theta$ is always $m$ times of the rigid part of $\theta$ for any positive integer $m \in {\mathbb{Z}} _{\geq 1}$.
To avoid this problem, we define the rigid part of the elements in the Grothendieck group in a different way; namely, we use the real Grothendieck group ${K_0(\mathrm{proj} A)} _\mathbb{R}$ and numerical torsion pairs of Baumann-Kamnitzer-Tingley.
In this talk, I will explain the detail of our definition and some important properties of our rigid parts.

### Some calculations about earthquake maps in the cross ratio coordinates
Thurston defined the earthquake map. It is a deformation of
hyperbolic surfaces and considered as the bijective map on the
universal cover $\mathbb{H}$. The earthquake theorem says that for any
orientation-preserving homeomorphism $f$ of $S^1$, there uniquely
exists an earthquake extended to $f$.   Bonsante—Krasnov—Schlenker
extended the theorem to the enhanced Teichmüller space of marked
surfaces. We calculate some earthquake maps on marked surfaes by the cross
ratio coordinates. They are earthquake maps along ideal arcs and along
a simple closed geodesic.

### Cluster-additive functions and tropical points
Let A be a symmetrizable generalized Cartan matrix of size r. A cluster-additive function associated to A is a map from Z times [1,r] to Z satisfying certain mesh type relations. Such functions were introduced by Ringel, which are closely related with additive functions in representation theory. We prove that cluster-additive functions associated to A are in bijection with the tropical points associated to a skew-symmetrizable matrix defined from A. We give an realization of cluster-additive functions using d-compatibility degree in cluster algebras. As one of the applications, we give a conceptual proof of Ringel's conjecture on cluster-additive functions. This is based on a work in progress joint with Antoine de St. Germain and Prof. Jiang-Hua Lu.

### Toric degenerations and Newton-Okounkov bodies of flag varieties arising from cluster structures
A toric degeneration is a flat degeneration of a projective variety to a toric variety, which can be used to apply the theory of toric varieties to other projective varieties. Using a multiplicative property of the dual canonical basis, Caldero constructed a toric degeneration of a flag variety to the toric variety associated with a string polytope. Magee and Bossinger-Fourier (respectively, Genz-Koshevoy-Schumann) studied relations between GHKK (Gross-Hacking-Keel-Kontsevich) superpotential polytopes and string polytopes in type A (respectively, in simply-laced type). In this talk, we define Newton-Okounkov bodies of flag varieties using a cluster structure, and see how these are related to GHKK superpotential polytopes. These Newton-Okounkov bodies give a cluster-theoretic realization of string polytopes in general Lie type. This talk is based on a joint work with Hironori Oya.

### Regular Positive Representations
In the study of positive representations of split real quantum groups, it is natural to consider an associated embedding of $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ to certain quantum cluster algebra related to the moduli space of framed $G$-local systems. Over the past few years, various new variations of such representations are realized as certain reduction of the original one, and share some common features which we call "regular". We will explain the current status of the classification of these regular positive representations.

### Two deformations of a Markov equation and related topics
I will talk about two kinds of deformations of a Markov equation.
One deformation is related to q-deformation of rational numbers introduced by Morier-Genoud and V.Ovsienko , that is connected to knot
 theory, hyperbolic geometry, cluster algebra.
The other deformation is related to Castling transformation of t-dimensional prehomogeneous vector spaces.

### Fans and polytopes in tilting theory
For a finite dimensional algebra $A$, the 2-term silting complexes of $A$ gives a simplicial complex $\Delta(A)$, called the $g$-simplicial complex,
a polytope $P(A)$, called the $g$-polytope and a fan $\Sigma(A)$, called the $g$-fan.
We study several properties of these three objects.
In particular, we give tilting theoretic interpretations of the $h$-vectors and Dehn-Sommerville equations of $\Delta(A)$.
Moreover, we discuss convexity of $P(A)$ and its dual polytope. We also discuss a classification of rank 2 $g$-fans.
This is joint work with Aoki-Higashitani-Iyama-Kase.

### Exchange graph of partial cluster tilting objects and subsurface collapsing
We introduce a new class of triangulated categories, which are Verdier quotients between 3-Calabi-Yau categories from (decorated) marked surfaces, and show that its spaces of stability conditions can be identified with moduli spaces of framed quadratic differentials on Riemann surfaces with arbitrary order zeros and arbitrary higher order poles. The skeletons of these spaces are coverings of exchange graphs of partial cluster tilting objects.
This is a joint work with Anna Barbieri, Martin Möller and Jeonghoon So.

### Cluster algebra and $q$-Painlevé equation: higher order generalization and degeneration structure
Recently, a birational representation of an extended affine Weyl group of type $A_{mn-1}^{(1)}\times A_{m-1}^{(1)}\times A_{m-1}^{(1)}$ was formulated with the aid of cluster mutation by Inoue-Ishibashi-Oya and Masuda-Okubo-Tsuda.
We derive Jimbo-Sakai's $q$-Painlev'\e VI equation and its higher order generalizations from this group.
We also propose confluences of vertices of quivers which imply the degeneration structure of the $q$-Painlev\'e equations.
This talk is based on the joint work with Prof. Naoto Okubo.

### Cluster and Skein algebra of unpunctured surfaces for $\mathfrak{sp}_4$
We introduce a skein algebra consisting of $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-webs on a 
marked surface $\Sigma$ without punctures and its 
$\mathbb{Z}_q$-subalgebra called the ``$\mathbb{Z}_q$-form''. We prove 
that the boundary-localization of the $\mathbb{Z}_q$-form is included in 
a quantum cluster algebra that quantizes the function ring of the moduli 
space of all decorated twisted $Sp_4$-local systems on $\Sigma$. In this 
talk, we explain the construction of the inclusion and a conjectural 
characterization of cluster variables using $\mathfrak{sp}_4$-webs. This 
talk is based on joint work with Tsukasa Ishibashi.
